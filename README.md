# Efficient Building Group - Vite React site

This is a minimal Vite React project prepared for deployment to Vercel.

How to run locally:

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Build for production:

1. npm run build
2. npm run preview

Vercel: point the project root to this folder and deploy. The site assumes the domain **ebuildinggroup.com**; configure that in your Vercel project settings.
